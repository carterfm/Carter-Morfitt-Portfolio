# <Carter-Morfitt-Portfolio>
## Description
In this project, I built a portfolio page from scratch. The page includes an 'About Me', 'Recent Work', and 'Contact Me' section, with a navbar in the header that links to each of these sections. 

The 'Recent Work' section contains five images which double as links to my other live projects.
  
The entire page is formatted to respond dynamically to screen size changes, and has both a desktop and mobile layout.
